# UI-components

This is a try to use [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) to create library with reusable components for [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) using [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

To bootstrap this project, I used [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
